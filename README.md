# narrator_remover-1.16
# EASY INSTALLATION: Go to the [releases](https://github.com/benoitsecret/narrator_remover-1.16/releases/tag/RELEASE) SECTION, GET THE .JAR AND SIMPLY DRAG IT TO YOUR `mods` FOLDER
# THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY **NOT** LEGAL FOR MCSR, THOUGH IT WOULD BE NICE TO CHANGE THAT

This simple Minecraft mod removes the annoying narrator that gets triggered when pressing CTRL and B keys at the same time.

It was designed for version 1.16.1 with speedrunning in mind. Requires Fabric version `0.15.6` or later, does not require the Fabric API.

When downloading the source, run `./gradlew build` in the terminal to build the jar,
make sure you are using **java 8** as the project language level.
Then go in /build/libs and you will find `narrator_remover-1.16.1.jar`
